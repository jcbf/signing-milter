<H2>NAME</H2>

signing-milter - sign email via milter protocol

<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>signing-milter</B>

[<I>options</I>]


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>signing-milter</B>

uses the
<I>milter</I>

interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
<B>sendmail(8),</B>

to provide signing service for mail transiting a milter-aware MTA.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Show summary of options and exit.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Show version of program and exit.
<DT><B>-c clientgroup</B>

<DD>
If socket is
<I>[unix|local]:path</I>

<I>signing-milter</I>

will adjust
<I>path</I>

to be read/writeable by group
<I>clientgroup.</I>

The group must be any group other then root and the group
<I>signing-milter</I>

runs as. The parameter is required unless using an TCP socket.
<DT><B>-d loglevel</B>

<DD>
Set the loglevel. The default level 3 logs all errors. Valid values are
effective syslog priorities as described in
<I>/usr/include/syslog.h</I>

<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
normaly
<I>signing-milter</I>

uses the envelope sender as signeraddress to lookup in the signingtable.
If enabled,
<I>signing-milter</I>

uses also the value of a header named
<B>X-Signer</B>

to lookup the signeraddress. This is useful when using VERP
(Variable Envelope Return Path).
<DT><B>-g group</B>

<DD>
Set the group
<I>signing-milter</I>

will run as if started as root. If omitted the groupname signing-milter is used.
<DT><B>-k directory</B>

<DD>
for debugging purposes
<I>signing-milter</I>

can store data to files. They are created in the named directory which must be
readable, writeable an executable by the user
<I>signing-milter</I>

runs as. It must not have any rights for other.
<I>signing-milter</I>

creates two files containing unsigned and signed data. The files are named
plain-QUEUEID and signed-QUEUEID. If omitted no files are written.
<DT><B>-m signingtable</B>

<DD>
<I>signing-milter</I>

uses a table to lookup corresponding signingmaterial to a given sender address.
This table is a
<I>cdb </I>

compiled database. The signingtable lists mailaddresses on the left (key), one
ore more spaces or tabs and a full path to an associates file (value). These
file must contain a signer certificate and a signer private key in PEM format.
<P>
The files containing certificates and private keys are security sensitive.
Therefore they must only be readable and not writeable for the user
<I>signing-milter</I>

runs as. Also they must not be world readable.
<P>
Feature available since version 20120731:
<BR>

If you put cert and key in a file named /path/to/foo-cert+key.pem then
<I>signing-milter</I>

also try to load /path/to/foo-chain.pem. If it exist it should contain
intermediate and root certificates that will be included in the signature.

<P>
NOTE:

<BR>
There is not special error signaled if /path/to/foo-chain.pem exist
but is unreadable for the user

<I>signing-milter</I>
run as.
When using chain certificates you should check the logs if it is really used.

<DT><B>-n modetable</B>

<DD>
<I>signing-milter</I>

can use this optional table to lookup recipient addresses. If at least one
recipient of a message is found in modetable, the result is applied to the
whole message.
<P>
The value may contain any combination of the following words:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>keep</B>

<DD>
for debugging purposes keep the plain and signed data unter /tmp/*-$queueid.
In contrast to the option
<I>-k</I>

the directory is fix and saving occour not for all messages.
<DT><B>opaque</B>

<DD>
the signingmode is switched from detached to opaque. Opaque mode is intended
to preserve signatures for mail transiting broken MTAs.
<DT><B>skip</B>

<DD>
message will not be signed and simply pass unchanged.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-s socket</B>

<DD>
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
<I>sendmail(8)</I>

in order to provide service.
<I>socket</I>

is in one of three forms:
<I>[unix|local]:path</I>

which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified path.
<I>inet:port[@host]</I>

which creates a TCP socket on the specified port.
<I>inet6:port[@host]</I>

which creates a TCPv6 socket on the specified port. If the host is not given as
either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be listening on all
interfaces. If no socket is given at all, the milter listen on
<I>inet6:30053@[::1].</I>

Let's push IPv6, yeah!
<DT><B>-t timeout</B>

<DD>
This is the number of seconds
<I>signing-milter</I>

will wait for an MTA communication (read or write) before timing out.
<DT><B>-u user</B>

<DD>
Set the user
<I>signing-milter</I>

will run as if started under root. If omitted the username signing-milter is
used.
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Causes
<I>signing-milter</I>

to add a header indicating the presence of this filter in the path of the
message from injection to delivery. The productname, version and hostname
are included in the headers contents.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY</H2>

The
<I>signing-milter</I>

is security-sensitive. It talks to an MTA and has access to otherwise
unprotected private keys. It must run at fixed low privilege. The
<I>signing-milter</I>

refuses to run with root privileges.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ACCOUNTS</H2>

You may start signing-milter as root. In this case
<I>signing-milter</I>

will switch to user/group signing-milter or the username given as -u and -g.
You may also switch to a unprivileged user and then start signing-milter.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LOCAL SOCKET</H2>

If you want
<I>signing-milter</I>

run with a local unixsocket it is important the socket is accessible by
<I>sendmail(8).</I>

In this case start
<I>signing-milter</I>

under root, set -u and -g (or leave them default) and set -c to a group
other then root and signing-milter.
<I>signing-milter</I>

will adjust the sockets owner, group and file mode to allow proper access by
<I>sendmail(8).</I>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

<I>signing-milter</I>

dumps statistical data on SIGALARM. The data contains the number of signed
messages and the total signingtime in seconds.milliseconds separated by /. All
counters are set to zero after SIGALARM. Also on SIGTERM statistical data are
logged.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STARTUP AND LOGGING</H2>

<I>signing-milter</I>

is designed to run by a supervisor like daemontools or runit. It does not fork
as daemon in background.  So all logging goes to syslog using facility LOG_MAIL.
All messages exept priority LOG_NOTICE and LOG_INFO are also sent to stdout.

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

The private signing keys must not be protected by password.
<I>signing-milter</I>

should also support GnuPG.  A changed signingtable is noticed but not reloaded.
<I>signing-milter</I>

must currently restart when the signingtable has changed. Same applies to the
modetable.
